# Hello-Tomohio-I-wanted-to-contact-you.
Hello tomohio i dont know if you will see this, but i wanted to contact you (and didnt come up with a different way of doing so), before i start I want to tell you who i am and why im i contacting you. i am enrique a student of computer science degree and on my final year. I will explain more in the readme. 


I am on my last year of the degree and therefore i have to do my Final Year Project, i am also an athlete of trak and field, and i wanted to train an ai to be able to study/analyze and evaluate/help improove track athletes running techniques.
I saw that you have been posting proyects related to this idea of using ai to evaluate/train over sports data. I recently saw 2 repositories yo have worked on: the AthleticsPose and the unsupervised-fine-tuning-pose3d-for-sports.

I wanted to ask you for help on getting some datasets of videos or images, primarly i wanted to know if it is possible for me to get acces to the videos used for the tooning of the data on the AthleticsPose repository given that it is more aimed at my goal (and also there is plenty more data from me to use in the training of my model).

I wish you could contact me about this if possible, i will leave you here my email and linkedIn profile. I thank you in advanced.
